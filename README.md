# Parkinson-disease-prediction
This Project presents an advanced approach to detecting Parkinson's disease with remarkable accuracy, leveraging the power of the XGBoost classifier. Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement, causing tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Early detection of Parkinson's disease is crucial for effective management and treatment.

Utilizing a dataset comprising various biomedical voice measurements, we employed state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to develop a robust diagnostic model. XGBoost, a highly efficient and scalable gradient boosting algorithm, was chosen for its exceptional performance in classification tasks and ability to handle complex datasets with high dimensionality.

Our model achieved an impressive accuracy of 94.87%, showcasing its efficacy in distinguishing between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy individuals. By harnessing features extracted from voice recordings, such as fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, and other acoustic attributes, our XGBoost classifier demonstrated superior predictive capabilities.

The significance of our project lies in its potential to revolutionize Parkinson's disease diagnosis by providing a non-invasive and cost-effective screening tool. With its high accuracy and reliability, our model can aid healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention, facilitating timely treatment and improving patient outcomes.

In addition to its diagnostic utility, our project contributes to the growing body of research on machine learning applications in healthcare. By leveraging advanced algorithms like XGBoost, we pave the way for innovative approaches to disease detection and personalized medicine, ultimately enhancing the quality of healthcare delivery.

Overall, our project represents a significant advancement in Parkinson's disease detection, offering a promising avenue for early intervention and improved patient care. With further refinement and validation, our model holds the potential to make a meaningful impact in the field of neurology and beyond.
